# ARRAY-SET-01
Array is continious memory allocation. It is static and  linear.

KEY FEATURES OF ARRAY:
Fixed Size: Once created, the size cannot be changed.

Indexed: Index starts from 0 up to length - 1.

Same Data Type: All elements must be of the same type (e.g., all integers or all strings).

Stored in Heap: Array objects are stored in heap memory.

Efficient Access: You can access any element using its index quickly.
